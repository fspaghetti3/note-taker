## Description

Note Taker is a lightweight web application that allows you to post notes to remind yourself of things to do!

- Opposed to previous projects of mine, this project stores data through an Express/Heroku cloud server!

- This means that whatever notes you make, everyone else can also make! (Please don't post this publically or I will have to spend millions :( )


## Installation

Note Taker can be used through any modern browser. It should run flawlessly with no errors (HOPEFULLY)

## Usage

Upon entering Note Taker, this is the screen you will be greeted with.
